        <p>
          Paul Davis and Brett Sievwright started Watermark Securities (Pty) Ltd in 1999 as a member
          of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).
        </p>

        <p>
          Both of us had worked for established stock brokers and we identified the need for personalised
          private JSE services – rather than chasing high volume institutional business.
        </p>

        <p>
          The removal of exchange controls and the ability to invest internationally necessitated a
          change in licence requirements and so the move from Watermark to a more fully fledged, multi
          FSCA licenced Freedom Capital (Pty) Ltd (FC) took place in 2014.
        </p>

        <p>
          Freedom Capital prides itself on very high levels of service in the industry and our loyal
          client base is testament to this character.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will continue to offer clients bespoke local and international equity share portfolios in
          both compulsory and non-compulsory investment structures.
        </p>

        <p>
          We love interacting with clients on a personal level and are strong believers in simplifying
          their finances in order to make the future as clear as possible.
        </p>

        <p class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
          We look forward to the next 25 years!
